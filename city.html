	<p><strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> (Malaysian pronunciation: [ˈkualə, -a ˈlumpo(r), -ʊ(r)]), officially the <strong>Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur</strong> (Malay: <em>Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur</em>) and colloquially referred to as <strong>KL</strong>, is a federal territory and the capital city of Malaysia. It is the largest city in <strong>Malaysia</strong>, covering an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) with an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016.[8] Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the <strong>Klang Valley</strong>, is an urban agglomeration of 7.564 million people as of 2018.[4] It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, in both population and economic development.

		<strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the <strong>Parliament of Malaysia</strong> and the official residence of the <em>Yang di-Pertuan Agong</em>, the <em>Istana Negara</em>. It first developed as a town serving the tin mines of the region circa 1857, before it became the capital of <strong>Selangor</strong> in 1880 until 1978, and the capital of <strong>Malaya</strong> before the formation of <strong>Malaysia</strong>. The city remained the seat of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government until these were relocated to <strong>Putrajaya</strong> in early 1999.[9] However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>.

	<strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> is one of the three federal territories of <strong>Malaysia</strong>,[10] enclaved within the state of Selangor, on the central west coast of <strong>Peninsular Malaysia</strong>.[11] Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the <strong>Petronas Towers</strong>, which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysia in general. </p>
